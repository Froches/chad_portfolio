    year: "August 2024",
    projectBackground:
      "Content creators and businesses often struggle with managing, creating, and distributing digital content efficiently, leading to time-consuming workflows and inconsistent quality. TiFi was developed to address these challenges by streamlining content creation and management processes.",
    goals:
      "TiFi&apos;s goal is to revolutionize content creation by leveraging the power of AI and machine learning. It simplifies the entire process, allowing users to effortlessly transcribe, summarize, and generate high-quality content. By automating these tasks, TiFi empowers users to focus on creativity and productivity, transforming the way content creators and businesses manage their digital output.",
    challenge:
      "Content creators often feel bogged down by tasks like transcription and summarization, leaving little time for creativity. With so much to juggle, they need a faster, smarter way to streamline content creation. The real challenge is finding a solution that makes these processes easier, freeing them up to focus on creativity and innovation.",

      "I led the redesign of the podcast summarizer and subscribe-to-plan flows for TiFi, with a focus on enhancing the overall user experience. My objective was to transform the initial design, ensuring consistency across components and pages while optimizing the usability of each flow.",
    designProcess: [
      "Ideation and Iteration",
      "When I joined the TiFi project, initially called AI-Convey, the foundation of the design system had already been established. I collaborated with a sub-team, including a Product Manager and developers across frontend, backend, and mobile. My first task was to redesign the pricing landing page and create a complete subscribe-to-plan flow.",
      "Following this, I was asked to revamp the podcast summarizer feature, utilizing the existing design system and introducing new elements when necessary. Throughout the ideation phase, ensuring the product met user needs while maintaining the original design aesthetics was crucial. I explored various inspirations to refine the design, focusing on presenting information clearly and enhancing the overall user experience.",

      "I approached this project with a straightforward, traditional design strategy, focusing on simplicity while adding a touch of fun. My goal was to avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary elements, ensuring they could easily accomplish tasks—such as summarizing a podcast—in the most user-friendly way possible.",
    conclusion:
      "Working on TiFi has been one of my most fulfilling projects to date. TiFi, designed to compete in the AI-assisted content creation sector, had an existing framework before I joined the team. My role focused on enhancing the overall user experience, ensuring a cohesive design, and improving the information architecture. Throughout this project, I gained invaluable experience collaborating with a large, dynamic team of creatives, adhering to tight deadlines, and participating in regular standups to deliver a live product. It was an enriching opportunity to help optimize content management for users.",
